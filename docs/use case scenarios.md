 Let me validate and expand on those scenarios:

  ✅ Your Scenarios Analysis:

  Scenario 1: Release with committed changes
  - ✅ Makes sense: 20 commits during dev cycle → generate
   changelog from commit diffs + descriptions
  - ✅ Current support: Already working (what we just
  fixed)

  Scenario 2: Pre-commit changelog generation
  - ✅ Makes sense: Uncommitted changes → generate
  changelog from working dir diffs → use as commit message
  - ✅ Practical use case: Especially useful for large
  commits or feature completion
  - ⚠️ Current support: Partially (shows files but not
  actual diff content) - need to fix this

  Scenario 3: Pending commits changelog
  - ✅ Makes sense: Staged changes → generate changelog
  before committing
  - ✅ Use case: Review what you're about to commit in
  changelog format

  Scenario 4: Dangling commits
  - ✅ Makes sense: Orphaned commits → generate changelog
  to understand what was lost
  - ✅ Use case: Recovery and understanding of detached
  HEAD work

  Scenario 5: Specific branch/commit range
  - ✅ Makes sense: Target specific commits or branch →
  focused changelog
  - ✅ Use case: Feature branch summaries, release notes
  for specific versions


  are the above scenarios implemented?

  🚀 Additional Scenarios We Should Consider:

  Scenario 6: Stashed changes
  - 📝 Use case: git stash list → generate changelog from
  stashed work
  - 📝 Value: Understand what work is temporarily stored

  add it

  Scenario 7: Merge conflict resolution
  - 📝 Use case: After resolving conflicts → generate
  changelog showing resolution
  - 📝 Value: Document merge decisions and conflict
  resolutions

  not for now

  Scenario 8: Cherry-pick documentation
  - 📝 Use case: Before/after cherry-picking → document
  what was ported
  - 📝 Value: Track feature/fix propagation across
  branches

  not for now

  Scenario 9: Rebase summary
  - 📝 Use case: After interactive rebase → summarize what
   changed
  - 📝 Value: Document history rewriting decisions

  add it

  Scenario 10: Tag-based releases
  - 📝 Use case: Between tags → generate release notes
  - 📝 Value: Automated release note generation

  add it

  Scenario 11: Author-specific changes
  - 📝 Use case: Filter by author → personal contribution
  summary
  - 📝 Value: Individual developer reports, code review
  preparation

add it

  Do these additional scenarios make sense? Should we
  prioritize implementing support for any of them, or
  focus on completing the core scenarios (1-5) first?
