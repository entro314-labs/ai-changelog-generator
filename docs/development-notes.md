# Development Notes & Use Case Scenarios

Internal development planning document for AI changelog generator feature development and use case validation.

## Core Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Release with Committed Changes ✅

**Status**: Implemented and working

- **Use case**: 20 commits during dev cycle → generate changelog from commit diffs + descriptions
- **Current support**: Fully working (main use case)

### Scenario 2: Pre-commit Changelog Generation ✅

**Status**: Implemented via working-dir command

- **Use case**: Uncommitted changes → generate changelog from working dir diffs → use as commit message
- **Practical use**: Especially useful for large commits or feature completion
- **Current support**: `ai-changelog working-dir` command

### Scenario 3: Pending Commits Changelog ✅

**Status**: Implemented

- **Use case**: Staged changes → generate changelog before committing
- **Practical use**: Review what you're about to commit in changelog format
- **Current support**: Working directory analysis includes staged changes

### Scenario 4: Dangling Commits ✅

**Status**: Implemented via branches analysis

- **Use case**: Orphaned commits → generate changelog to understand what was lost
- **Practical use**: Recovery and understanding of detached HEAD work
- **Current support**: `ai-changelog branches` shows dangling commits

### Scenario 5: Specific Branch/Commit Range ✅

**Status**: Implemented

- **Use case**: Target specific commits or branch → focused changelog
- **Practical use**: Feature branch summaries, release notes for specific versions
- **Current support**: `--since` and `--from-commits` options

## Additional Scenarios for Future Implementation

### Scenario 6: Stashed Changes

**Status**: Planned for implementation

- **Use case**: `git stash list` → generate changelog from stashed work
- **Value**: Understand what work is temporarily stored
- **Implementation**: Add `ai-changelog stash` command

### Scenario 7: Rebase Summary

**Status**: Planned for implementation

- **Use case**: After interactive rebase → summarize what changed
- **Value**: Document history rewriting decisions
- **Implementation**: Add `ai-changelog rebase-summary` command

### Scenario 8: Tag-based Releases

**Status**: Planned for implementation

- **Use case**: Between tags → generate release notes
- **Value**: Automated release note generation
- **Implementation**: Enhance `--since` to support tag ranges

### Scenario 9: Author-specific Changes

**Status**: Planned for implementation

- **Use case**: Filter by author → personal contribution summary
- **Value**: Individual developer reports, code review preparation
- **Implementation**: Add `--author` filter option

## Feature Planning Notes

### Architecture Considerations

- Provider plugin system is working well
- MCP integration provides good Claude Desktop experience
- Working directory analysis needs diff content (not just file lists)
- Need better handling of binary files and large diffs

### Provider Performance Notes

- OpenAI GPT-4o: Best overall performance and reliability
- Anthropic Claude: Excellent for detailed code analysis
- Local models (Ollama): Good for privacy but limited context
- Azure OpenAI: Enterprise features but complex setup

### User Experience Improvements Needed

- Better progress indicators for long operations
- More informative error messages
- Cleaner output formatting (partially done)
- Interactive provider setup wizard

### Technical Debt Areas

- Consolidate utility functions (many overlapping helpers)
- Standardize error handling across providers
- Improve test coverage for edge cases
- Better logging and debugging tools

## Development Priorities

### High Priority

- Implement stashed changes analysis
- Add author filtering capabilities
- Improve working directory diff analysis
- Better binary file handling

### Medium Priority

- Tag-based release automation
- Rebase summary functionality
- Enhanced CI/CD integration
- Performance optimizations

### Low Priority

- Visual changelog generation
- Advanced template system
- Plugin architecture for third-party extensions
- Web interface for changelog management

## Testing Scenarios

### Edge Cases to Test

- Empty repositories
- Large repositories (>1000 commits)
- Binary files and images
- Merge commits and conflicts
- Renamed and moved files
- Permission issues
- Network connectivity problems
- API rate limiting

### Provider-Specific Testing

- Model availability and fallbacks
- Token limit handling
- Streaming responses
- Error recovery
- Cost optimization

## Notes for Contributors

### Adding New Providers

- Follow BaseProvider interface
- Implement all required methods
- Add configuration validation
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add to provider manager
- Update documentation

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Include unit tests for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes

### Review Checklist

- All providers still working after changes
- Error handling covers edge cases
- Documentation updated
- Tests pass
- No breaking changes without version bump
- Security considerations reviewed
