# AI Changelog Generator - Roadmap

High-level roadmap and feature planning for the AI Changelog Generator project.

## üîß **Incomplete Implementations & Placeholders**

### Core Functionality Issues
- [ ] **Complete Git Commit Execution** - Fix `ai-changelog commit` command (currently shows "coming soon" for actual commit execution)
- [ ] **AI Commit Message Generation** - Implement the AI-powered commit message generation that's currently marked as "coming soon"
- [ ] **CLI Command Execute Method** - Implement the abstract `execute()` method in `cli.controller.js` (currently throws "not implemented" error)
- [ ] **Vertex AI Image Fetching** - Implement remote image fetching in `vertex.js` (currently throws "not implemented" error)
- [x] **AI Response Null/Undefined Handling** - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')" error in `workspace-changelog.service.js` when AI response is null/undefined (occurs when no .env configured)
- [x] **Azure Token Limit Too Low** - Fixed token limits to be dynamic based on analysis mode: detailed=3000, enterprise=4000, with extra tokens for large commits (up to 8000)
- [ ] **Large Diff Handling Strategy** - Unified smart diff compression architecture
  - [ ] **Create DiffProcessor utility** - Central diff processing with intelligent summarization 
  - [ ] **Update buildEnhancedPrompt** - Replace simple truncation with smart diff processing
  - [ ] **Update workspace-changelog.service.js** - Use unified DiffProcessor for both methods
  - [ ] **Update git.service.js** - Integrate smart diff generation at source
  - [ ] **Add diff filtering pipeline** - Remove whitespace, formatting, comments, imports
  - [ ] **Add change pattern detection** - Detect bulk renames, formatting, dependency updates
  - [ ] **Add hierarchical file processing** - Process files in importance order, not all at once

### Template System
- [ ] **Custom Template Engine Implementation** - Currently only TypeScript definitions exist, need actual template rendering
- [ ] **Template Sharing Platform** - Implement community template repository mentioned in types
- [ ] **Visual Template Rendering** - Complete HTML/PDF output formats beyond basic markdown

### Provider Improvements  
- [ ] **Mock Provider Enhancement** - Currently basic, needs better simulation of real provider behaviors
- [ ] **Provider Failure Simulation** - Improve mock provider's failure rate and latency controls
- [ ] **Development Mode Detection** - Better handling of development vs production provider selection

### Error Handling & UX
- [ ] **Abstract Method Error System** - Complete implementation of the `NotImplementedError` class usage across codebase
- [ ] **Better Placeholder Messages** - Replace generic "undefined" returns with meaningful error messages
- [ ] **Development Phase Warnings** - Remove hardcoded "development phase" messages when features are complete

## üöÄ **Near-term Features (Next 1-2 Releases)**

### Enhanced Git Analysis

- [ ] **Stashed Changes Analysis** - Generate changelog from `git stash` entries
- [ ] **Author-Specific Changelogs** - Filter changes by specific contributors
- [ ] **Tag-Based Release Notes** - Automated release notes between version tags
- [ ] **Rebase Summary** - Document changes after interactive rebases

### User Experience Improvements  

- [ ] **Progress Indicators** - Better visual feedback for long operations
- [ ] **Interactive Setup Wizard** - Guided provider configuration
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Messages** - More actionable troubleshooting guidance
- [ ] **Watch Mode** - Auto-regenerate changelog on file changes

### Provider Enhancements

- [ ] **Model Auto-Discovery** - Automatically detect available models per provider
- [ ] **Cost Optimization** - Smart model selection based on complexity and budget
- [ ] **Provider Health Monitoring** - Real-time status and performance tracking

## üîÆ **Future Features (Medium-term)**

### Advanced Output & Templates

- [ ] **Custom Template Engine** - User-defined changelog templates

- [ ] **Issue tracker integration** - Link to GitHub/Jira/Linear issues
- [ ] **Package manager integration** - Track dependency changes (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
- [ ] **Release Automation** - Auto-tag, create releases, update package.json
- [ ] **VS Code Extension** - Native VS Code integration with diff analysis  
- [ ] **Semantic Release Integration** - Automatic version bumping and publishing

### Enterprise & Advanced Features
